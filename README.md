# us-tx-monkeypox-tracker
This tool uses Github actions to track the number of Monkeypox cases in the US using data from the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html). The data is then funneled into graphics for the [San Antonio Express-News](https://www.expressnews.com/).
